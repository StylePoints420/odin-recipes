        <h2 class = "headings">Description</h2>
        <p class = "list">Since Halloween is coming at the time of this project's submission, the last recipe would be a Halloween Skull Cupcake!<br>
        This cupcake was inspired by the movie 'Night of the living Dead' according to the author!</p>
        <h2 class = "headings">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class = "list">
            <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix (such as Duncan HinesÂ®)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <!-- &#189 = 1/2-->
            <li>1 &#189 (16 ounce) packages prepared vanilla frosting</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) pouch prepared chocolate frosting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class = "headings" id = "steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol class = "list">
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners, preferable dark-colored or Halloween-themed ones.</li>
            <li>
                Combine cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds.
                Beat at medium speed until batter is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 21 minutes.
                Remove from oven and cool tins on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the tins and cool completely
                on a wire rack before decorating, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Frost each cupcake with a thin layer of white vanilla frosting and refrigerate for 30 minutes to make decorating easier.</li>
            <li>
                Remove cupcakes from fridge and apply a second layer of white frosting.
                Fill a piping bag outfitted with a small round tip with chocolate frosting and draw a skull face on the cupcakes:
                pipe large ovals for the eyes, two dots for the nostrils, and a large "stitched" smile for the mouth.
            </li>
        </ol>
