        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe is not your usual chicken Parmesan! Instead, chicken tenders are coated in a mixture of freshly grated Parmesan cheese
            and Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, fried to a golden brown, and finished in a lovely cream sauce.

        <p>A side of pasta would be good with this, or try mashed potatoes. A green vegetable and a salad will complete this dinner menu, nicely!</p>
